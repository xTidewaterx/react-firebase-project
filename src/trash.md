
we are updating comments, we are returning the comment correctly from firebase
problem is, the values we want to add to the fireabsse are misguided

our specific comments gets the wrong



we now have correct firebase data, all replies are eadded dwwe do await to get the backlog of the exacctttt




value comign form generated id only know aftyer creation after creation lthen


firebase 
value,

currently:: our update of the 



newest always gets pushed to the bottom
a comment is new when we push it to the bottom, that is alright



 okay we shall update the comment collection, we havd e done that before, ehre.:



we now have a directed targget missile, it updated the array of something it has the values we 


all id correct, original text and array of reply on top of exact target location id match array array target precise array value map into state and exact target on event then initialise with registered db . doc exact id, special id with arrray, all current values iwth intended target engatged array value

all comments now have id value that matches their origin, ,we have creation with .then, shrot creation
then extensive development of new creation
we have our collefction and useffect when we kick in replyid on reply we use the map id, 

then after useffect kicks in we take  this id from state map, we use the exact comment id matches all around from map iteration, now array value bounce,
now we hvae directed target missile, then we devleop the exact update that is current array that we find from map array
we updata nd all on this exact id of doc  update db collection and we develop all on exact value ,adn we cna now have values be what they are except we have yupdated value target initiated, action intent 


create all the values with state update from exact event map value array attack with nested array

array is mapped in map then this exact map sovle for all this and have reply on top of that have unique id



we have all values , now on reply we push a value to the array of current 


value we have certain index


if each comment now has a vlue that is a unique id, we can reference unique comments, the id is created original 
therefore
 any id is now to separate them by something unique, we  have post and we can do this id id o f iteration  now is id value in obejct same as comment original


// we now have comment id, with this we can allow all of our replies to target certain id

//we can have nested values all link to specific within array


now iwth unique identifier that is the true database value in object we a

we map object with true helepr identifier, synchronus state 


//we have now callback wehre value is added after id is created, id is created 

immediate update same play , we can do nothing then entire 


we have vlauies and confirm this is value



firstly on reply, we create an array that is the new value of our comment, it is the same, except we update the reply values as we are no submitting reply






value specific create with id we can then refereence id and have lalim portant values to create edit of post same with array change, we have id from doc  ons instance event sourrounded




on reply log commentid

useffect handle side effect in react functional compoennts 




//our reply button will change a state to a postcomment id, this postcomment id state will alert useffect that thjen thoes the entire update on  state change, it awaits the state tchange and updates  acta

side effect useeffect

it aawait clalback useffecttttt


values









const postComment = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(postId)
  console.log(postId)

  console.log(postId)

  //long row of accesspoints, we have db link, then collection firebase directory link and renderedpostId
  db.collection("posts").doc(postId).collection("comments").add({
    text: comment,
    username: currentUser,
    timestamp: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  
  })

}


we use update, we upådate spåecific iteration we have array value ,and exact array value we have id form uti


how can we log entire object and on an action we involve the specific target, we have the post, then comments, and each comment different array with replies that target exact comment, comment is singualr in a post


many comments, each comment different,


we now have collection doc and collection db firebase link


destcturcturing
destructuring we have values and direct array map inside of map iterateabl

we have values and syncrhonus 
sycnhronous 


we have value we can scan conditionally, only depdnant
depoendant
dependant 

we have a map of the datat wehere commenc tcollelction string vlaues liels in the databased 



now we must do that except we only update the  replies section, example::




const postReply = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(postId)
  console.log(postId)

  console.log(postId)

  //long row of accesspoints, we have db link, then collection firebase directory link and renderedpostId
  db.collection("posts").doc(postId).collection("comments").add({
 
 replies: array


  })

}


























each reply we update comment, we do the same here now 

on reply we updatge comment jsut as with ergular comment, except all we do 
is update the array part of our comment, 

we give it a completed array
this array is completed as such::

take current array, empty if no replies, 
with values if replies
take the array and push values into it, now we have a compelted array
this array goes back inbto the comment and its replies array value




















now array within array, means sort within sort
map within map

now for each element we check for ? [] value map 






values nested



changed values

changed values 


values
